# Philosophers
**The purpose of this project is to solve the *'dining philosophers problem'* using multithreading**

We will need to develop a program that enables a group of philosophers to share limited resources while avoiding different issues like deadlock. 

*The main instructions for this project are:*

      • One or more philosophers are sitting at a round table doing one of three things:
      eating, thinking, or sleeping.

      • There are some forks on the table. It is assumed that a philosopher must eat with two forks, one for each hand.

      • Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping. Then, he will start thinking.

      • The simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
